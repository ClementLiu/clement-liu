I used the concept from Buckminster Fuller, in which humans view the earth as a spaceship and every spice should be united for the best of our Spaceship instead of split parts. In the future cyborg world, Buckminster’s wish accomplished by communicating technology.",

            p I design a future poster hanged around the conference hall to call people to join the bigger community. Why each individual in the cyborg future is important rather than a disposable gear? The value of each individual for the big community will be individuals’ rich memories and behaviors.
          .col-sm-6.pl0 
            p Every individual’s memory is as important as others in history. Through collecting as much data as possible, we will have a better understanding of the bigger community, human society, and the spaceship Earth.
