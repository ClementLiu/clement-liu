              |In future design class, we were asked to design a poster to unveil the potential future we are heading. I looked into the cyborg world where human is connected with technology and being part of the big system. I used the concept from Buckminster Fuller, in which humans view the earth as a spaceship and every spice should be united for the best of our Spaceship instead of split parts. In the future cyborg world, Buckminster’s wish accomplished by communicating technology.

            .col-sm-6.pl0 
              p I design a future poster hanged around the conference hall to call people to join the bigger community. Why each individual in the cyborg future is important rather than a disposable gear? The value of each individual for the big community will be individuals’ rich memories and behaviors.
            .col-sm-6.pl0 
              p Every individual’s memory is as important as others in history. Through collecting as much data as possible, we will have a better understanding of the bigger community, human society, and the spaceship Earth.
