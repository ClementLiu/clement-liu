I realized when the impressive effects have more connections to users, they are more likely to remember. Therefore, I focus on the task about how to build the links.

            p.mb0 On the home screen, the prediabetes fact doesn’t have a relation to the vending process. We switch the sugar meter and fact to reduce the visual attention on the fact. The stroke number would be filled after the meter reaches the daily sugar suggestion.
            p.mb0 We clarify the sugar amount with the indicator bar on each item. The bar height is the same as the height that will be added to the meter.
            p.mb0 To quickly understanding the choice, we simplify the description to words. The option can be toggled to switch between options.
