          des:"After a rapid test, we realized that users have various situations. At the same time, there are different policy details response to different issues, like house support, medical cost waive, pregnant support, transportation help, etc. And thinking about our initial idea is to adding care for potential HIV users. Instead of keeping them in the application with a bunch of information, it would be better to prepare the user to walk out of the application to find the right people providing specific help and confirm the test. Meanwhile, I learn the HIV prevention model is “test, link, and treat.” The community section is far more important than HIV facts for potential HIV users. The application could help positive user easier to get to HIV service locations. And this function would be a similar service as the support phone call to make the user feel being cared for. Meanwhile, the usage of this function can be easily tracked as an indicator.",
