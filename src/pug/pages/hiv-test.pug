          h5.mb8 Test, link, and treat—locator guild HIV positive user to the service around.
          p After a rapid test, we realized that users have various situations. At the same time, there are different policy details response to different issues, like house support, medical cost waive, pregnant support, transportation help, etc. And thinking about our initial idea is to adding care for potential HIV users. Instead of keeping them in the application with a bunch of information, it would be better to prepare the user to walk out of the application to find the right people providing specific help and confirm the test. Meanwhile, I learn the HIV prevention model is “test, link, and treat.” The community section is far more important than HIV facts for potential HIV users. The application could help positive user easier to get to HIV service locations. And this function would be a similar service as the support phone call to make the user feel being cared for. Meanwhile, the usage of this function can be easily tracked as an indicator.

          p.small We decided to add a Locator function for users to have a more distinct view of HIV services around them. The goal is to make the locator accessible and friendly for the user and reduce the friction of going to the test site.

          p We provide information about HIV test service that would help the positive user get confirmation from the doctor.  We also include the HIV.gov API for HIV service provider information to give a broader service for HIV patients, including treatments and mental health. When there is a high density of spots, the icon will show the amount of them. With the user's permission of zip code, the user would see the recommended service around them as a list or a map. Sorting and filter, like closest test service, language preference, and test type, would help the user to make a choice.

If right now is not the appropriate time to have a test, it would lead the user to set a reminder for a future test. We used the status bar to indicate the steps left for giving the user a sense of control, and know what's going to happen. In the test part, we used a different color to prepare the user for doing the test mentally.

          p Users would search the service based on service type and location. It’s hard for the user to make the contact decision with a long list of the service names. And we move the zip from the top to the lower part, which is placed in Thumb Zone. In the popup page, there are icons to clarify the information, add the CTA buttons to simplify the contact, save, and share process.
